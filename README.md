## Welcome to Kanopy programming test !

### Summary

This test is designed to evaluate your Python programming skills. It should take you about 2 hours, although time spent is not an evaluation criterion.

### Instructions

We ask you to:

*   Fork this repository to your own Github account ;
*   Update original files `exercise.py` and `cinema.py` with your solution. Of the original files, only these 2 should be modified but you can add as many additional files / documents as you want in your commit.
*   Reply to your interviewer with a link to your forked repository once you’re done. **Do not create a Pull Request** as this is a public repository.


The folder `data` contains two files : `data/data.csv` contains the _MSCI World_ total return price history in Euro and this is the financial series you should use to test your functions ; `data/output.csv` contains the same series as well as the expected output for the `macd` function you will write in `exercise.py`.

`exercise.py` : contains some functions you have to fill in along with a description of the requested behaviour of the function.

You are not expected to know these ratios / functions and it’s part of the exercise to see how you go about learning & implementing your solution for each function.

`cinema.py` : Build a small program which transforms Data from the internet into a specified format

### Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the following aspects:

*   **Functionality**: your code should produce the expected output without execution error ;
*   **Readability**: your code should be easily readable for standard users. Feel free to comment or add documentation to your code ;
*   **Efficiency**: your code should perform the requested task in an efficient way.

If you unable to complete any of the questions, provide explanations of what issues you encoutered and how you tried to solve it.

Best of luck,

Kanopy research & development team
